     * <p>
     * Write a method <i>splitStack</i> that takes a stack of integers as a parameter and splits it into negatives and non-negatives.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * The numbers in the stack should be rearranged so that all the negatives appear on the bottom of the stack
     * and all the non-negatives appear on the top. In other words, if after this method is called you were to pop numbers off the stack,
     * you would first get all the nonnegative numbers and then get all the negative numbers.
     * It does not matter what order the numbers appear in, as long as all the negatives appear lower in the stack 
     * than all the non-negatives. You may use a single queue as auxiliary storage.
     * </p>
     * @param s - Stack containing negative and non-negative integers.
     * @return Stack rearranged such that non-negative appear on top and negative integers are at the bottom.
