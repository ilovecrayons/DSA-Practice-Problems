    /**
     * <p>
     * Write a method stutter that takes a stack of integers as a parameter and replaces every value in the stack
     * with two occurrences of that value. For example, suppose the stack stores these values:
     * </p>
     * <pre>
     * bottom [3, 7, 1, 14, 9] top
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * Then the stack should store these values after the method terminates:
     * </p>
     * <pre>
     * bottom [3, 3, 7, 7, 1, 1, 14, 14, 9, 9] top
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * Notice that you must preserve the original order. In the original list the 9 was at the top and would have been popped first.
     * In the new stack the two 9s would be the first values popped from the stack.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * You may use a single queue as auxiliary storage to solve this problem.
     * </p>
